* Granular Asset Pricing (Job Market Paper)

  {{< figure library="true" src="Granular.png" title="" >}}
  * Abstract: The market capitalization distribution of US firms has a fat tail populated by the largest firms. I refer to this fat tail as granularity and show it breaks the diversification of idiosyncratic risks assumed by arbitrage pricing theory (APT) to imply factor models. In cross-section, large firms have higher idiosyncratic risk premiums than small firms despite having a lower level of risk. This finding explains the negative relation between idiosyncratic risk and risk premium, known as the "idiosyncratic risk premium puzzle." On aggregate, the level of granularity, measured by the Pareto distribution, explains market expected returns since it determines the under-diversification of idiosyncratic risk.
